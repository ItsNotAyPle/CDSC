# CDSC

## BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This project is still in early development and not released yet, it's mostly usable, but not polished, still missing many features, and the codebase could use many optimizations, cleanup, and fixes. All the data structures are memory leak-free but no further security auditing has been done. This will change in the future.
See the "TODO" issue for progress.
