# CDSC
CDSC is a pure C library that contains implementations for 10 data structures with more and more coming,
it aims at being simple and safe, all while being complete and well documented and covering common data structure needs.

CDSC contains implementations of the following data structures:
- Doubly Linked List
- Deque
- Queue
- Stack
- Tree
- Binary tree
- Graph
- Hashtable
- Heap  
- Union-find (Disjoint set)
  
Each one of them can be built and used individually (though some of them depend on other ones).
None of them require any external dependencies.

## Documentation  
  
Complete and intuitive documentation for each CDSC data structure is currently being worked on.  

## BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This project is still in early development and not released yet, it's mostly usable, but not polished, still missing many features, and the codebase could use many optimizations, cleanup, and fixes. All the data structures are memory leak-free but no further security auditing has been done. This will change in the future.
See the "TODO" issue for progress.
